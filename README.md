# Khaz Custom twitch overlay 
Built on web components for better flexibility, even if I never ended up using those compoments correctly
Uses SVG images as the base to create SVG elements that can be modified (probably a silly way to go about it)
Elements are loaded as needed without putting the whole thing in memory (I think, that was the idea anyways)
